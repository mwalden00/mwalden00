- 👋 Hi, I’m @mwalden00
- 👀 I’m interested in pretty much anything right now, I've done all kinds of things from traditional theoretical computer science, to designing graphics engines in C, and to making pretty curves on a scatter plot using logorithmic regression!
- 🌱 I’m currently undergoing a Computer Science and Mathematics degree at the University of Edinburgh, and looking to get a Mathematics masters in the future maybe.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on literally anything just hit me up :D
